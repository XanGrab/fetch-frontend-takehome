[fetch-frontend-takehome](https://xangrab.github.io/fetch-frontend-takehome/)

## API Reference

We provide our own backend to facilitate searching/fetching dog info. The base URL is https://frontend-take-home-service.fetch.com.
Data Model

Here is the Typescript interface for the Dog objects returned by our API:

interface Dog {
    id: string
    img: string
    name: string
    age: number
    zip_code: string
    breed: string
}

We also provide endpoints for fetching location data, which should be useful if you’d like to implement filtering dogs by location. Here is the Typescript interface for the Location objects returned by our API:

interface Location {
    zip_code: string
    latitude: number
    longitude: number
    city: string
    state: string
    county: string
}

interface Coordinates {
    lat: number;
    lon: number;
}

Authentication

You will need to hit the login endpoint in order to access other endpoints. A successful request to the login endpoint will return an auth cookie included in the set-cookie response header. It’s an HttpOnly cookie, so you will not be able to access this value from any Javascript code (nor should you need to). Your browser will automatically send this cookie with all successive credentialed requests to the API. Note that you will need to pass a config option in order to send credentials (cookies) with each request. Some documentation to help you with this:

    Including credentials with fetch (set credentials: 'include' in request config)
    Including credentials with axios (set withCredentials: true in request config)

Postman will do this for you automatically.
POST /auth/login
Body Parameters

    name - the user’s name
    email - the user’s email

Example

// API Request Function
...
body: {
    name: string,
    email: string
}
...

Response

200 OK

An auth cookie, fetch-access-token, will be included in the response headers. This will expire in 1 hour.
POST /auth/logout

Hit this endpoint to end a user’s session. This will invalidate the auth cookie.
GET /dogs/breeds
Return Value

Returns an array of all possible breed names.
GET /dogs/search
Query Parameters

The following query parameters can be supplied to filter the search results. All are optional; if none are provided, the search will match all dogs.

    breeds - an array of breeds
    zipCodes - an array of zip codes
    ageMin - a minimum age
    ageMax - a maximum age

Additionally, the following query parameters can be used to configure the search:

    size - the number of results to return; defaults to 25 if omitted
    from - a cursor to be used when paginating results (optional)
    sort - the field by which to sort results, and the direction of the sort; in the format sort=field:[asc|desc]

Return Value

Returns an object with the following properties:

    resultIds - an array of dog IDs matching your query
    total - the total number of results for the query (not just the current page)
    next - a query to request the next page of results (if one exists)
    prev - a query to request the previous page of results (if one exists)

The maximum total number of dogs that will be matched by a single query is 10,000.
POST /dogs
Body Parameters

The body should be an array of no more than 100 dog IDs to fetch (no pun intended).

// API Request Function
...
body: string[]
...

Return Value

Returns an array of dog objects
POST /dogs/match
Body Parameters

The body of this request should be an array of dog IDs.

Example

// API Request Function
...
body: string[]

Return Value

This endpoint will select a single ID from the provided list of dog IDs. This ID represents the dog the user has been matched with for adoption.

interface Match {

Example

// API Request Function
...
body: string[]
...

Return Value

Returns an array of Location objects.
POST /locations/search
Body Parameters

The following body parameters can be supplied to filter the search results. All are optional; if none are provided, the search will match all locations.

    city - the full or partial name of a city
    states - an array of two-letter state/territory abbreviations
    geoBoundingBox - an object defining a geographic bounding box:
        This object must contain one of the following combinations of properties:
            top, left, bottom, right
            bottom_left, top_right
            bottom_right, top_left
        Each property should have the following data:
            lat - latitude
            lon - longitude

Additionally, the following body parameters can be used to configure the search:

    size - the number of results to return; defaults to 25 if omitted
    from - a cursor to be used when paginating results (optional)

The maximum total number of ZIP codes that will be matched by a single query is 10,000.

Example

// API Request Function
...
body: {
    city?: string,
    states?: string[],
    geoBoundingBox?: {
        top?: Coordinates,
        left?: Coordinates,
        bottom?: Coordinates,
        right?: Coordinates,
        bottom_left?: Coordinates,
        top_left?: Coordinates
    },
    size?: number,
    from?: number
}
...

Return Value

Returns an object with the following properties:

    results - an array of Location objects
    total - the total number of results for the query (not just the current page)

{
    results: Location[],
    total: number
